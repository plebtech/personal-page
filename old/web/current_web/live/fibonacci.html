				The recursive method is decidedly more compact and elegant, but in this case economy of code translates into horrible inefficiency, as each element is generated independently. Example: to find the 5th element, it finds the 4th and 3rd; the 4th must be generated by finding the 3rd and 2nd; the 3rd is generated by finding the 2nd and 1st, etc. Each and every element is determined by independently generating the two previous elements with no reference to any previous calculations, so even though it is simple addition, the number of operations rises exponentially as the depth of the elements increases. My desktop bogged down somewhere around the 30th element and I lacked the courage to attempt overflowing the datatype (I assume an overflow would be caught by the try-catch error-checking, as it is implemented and operational in the iterative method).
