	<div class = "main_block_text">I added a third algorithm to the program: a recursive approach using an array. The sequence is generated recursively to the specified element, but each element is stored in an array as it is calculated; the output method then references these values as it prints to the message box without calling the recursive method for every element/line. This blend of recursion (array population) and iteration (output) proves much more efficient than recursion alone, but still falls well short of the iterative method in terms of speed.</div>
	<div class = "main_block_text">I also cleaned up the previous two methods, and added timing to better measure relative efficiency. The screenshots below illustrate the difference between pure recursion (first image) and the array approach (second image).</div>

	<div class = "main_block_text">This is a practice project I initiated to combine concepts from two of my recent courses. I developed it in Visual Studio using C# (using techniques from a Business Programming course) to illustrate some differences in iterative and recursive methods, specifically involving the Fibonacci Sequence (encountered in my Discrete Structures CS course).</div>

	<div class = "main_block_text">The application was developed in Visual Studio and requires the .NET Framework 2.0, so unfortunately it is Windows-only. .NET 2.0 is included in Vista and later Windows versions, but XP users will need to install the framework.</div>
