				<p>OP, I want to talk to you seriously. See, I was once like you. Here's some ass btw.</p>

				<p>College dropout, broke, unemployed. On the verge of losing my apartment. Here's what I did:</p>

				<p>1. Work for Convergys or any of the work at home call centers. They pay you $10 / hr to train while at home, and training is like watching cartoons in your shorts its so easy.</p>

				<p>The training lasts about 6 weeks. While you are doing it, apply for a job with another call center so when the 6 weeks is up and they want you to be a fulltime DirecTV slave, you can quit and move on to another lazy ass work at home job.</p>

				<p>2. The secret is, while you are lol "training" and getting paid to sit home and smoke weed, go to Plurasight or any other web developer training site and learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, C# , etc and learn to build websites.</p>

				<p>Takes about 3 months and you can start getting jobs on Elance and Guru almost immediately. Most web site designers make $30 to $50 an hour.</p>

				<p>3. Next, while you are getting bullshit jobs on Elance, etc., learn back end framework development on shit like ASP.NET MVC, or Zend, or Symfony and become an expert in one of them.</p>

				<p>Back end developers dont need college degrees, only experience counts, and starting salaries are around $100k annual depending on where you live.</p>

				<p>4. PROTIP: you can do all this from home right in front of your 'puter. I'm working right now in my shorts and fucking around on /b/. I make $119k as a C# developer for a company in California. I live in Texas. The end.</p>
